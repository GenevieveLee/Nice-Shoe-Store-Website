        <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
            include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your
            privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
            and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
            to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
            your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
